# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using a project? Here's how.

## How to get help

For any usage **questions that are not specific to the project** itself, please ask
on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) instead. By doing so, you are more likely to quickly
solve your problem, and you will allow anyone else with the same question to find the answer. This
also allows maintainers to focus on improving the project for others.

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: **Read the documentation and other guides** for the project to see if you can figure it
   out on your own. These should be already on [README.md](README.md). Please read fires to learn
   how it works to see if you can answer your question.

2. :bulb: **Search for answers and ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).**
   This is the most appropriate place for debugging issues specific to your use of the project, or
   figuring out how to use the project in a specific way.

3. :memo: As a **last resort**, if the question regarding this project you may open
   new [discussion](https://github.com/waffiqaziz/storyzz/discussions) on GitHub to ask for
   help. However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already
   attempted to solve the problem. Provide code samples, but **do not** attach your entire project
   for someone else to debug. Review our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
