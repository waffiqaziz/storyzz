   Make sure all dependencies are up to date:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. Run the Tests
  
   - To run unit and widget tests :

     ```bash
     flutter test

        flutter test --coverage && genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
        ```

      - windows (PowerShell)

        ```bash
        flutter test --coverage && perl $env:GENHTML coverage\lcov.info -o coverage\html
        ```

      - windows (Command Prompt)

        ```bash
        flutter test --coverage && perl %GENHTML% coverage\lcov.info -o coverage\html
